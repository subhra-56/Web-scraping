Well let me show you:What EAC will do for VRChat:Lower frameratesIncrease instabilityStop script kiddiesStop ""wholesome"" mods, accessibility mods, and quality of life modsStop AMD FSR/RSR, Intel XeSS, Nvidia VRWorks SLI from improving your framerateStop select SteamVR mods that modify the game's runtimeStop programs like AudioTeapot (audio manager/soundboard) from workingStop Linux users from playing via proton (they claimed it wouldn't yet it does)Stop Linux users from playing via Windows virtual machinesLower the playerbaseWhat EAC will NOT do for VRChat:Stop ripping (Avatar cache is still unprotected)Stop crashing (Crasher avatars)Stop all malicious mods (Those devs see this as a programming challenge)Stop all malicious actors (There's other ways of being annoying)Stop SDK moddingStop user harassment (Stop claiming this!)Close the security holes in VRC UdonImprove the game experienceWhat EAC has done in the present/past:Take routine snapshots of the user's desktop/video bufferScan all processes running on user's machinesKill or try to kill all ""unknown"" or ""untrusted"" or ""unregistered"" running processes (including homemade processes)Locate the files of ""unknown"" or ""untrusted"" or ""unregistered"" processes and upload them to Epic's serversScan the user's C:\Users\ folder and appdata folderStop users from launching the game if Windows fails to install/update itself ""correctly"" (google""easyanticheat UNEXPECTED-KERNEL-MODE-TRAP"", though epic tries to censor this issue)Stop device drivers that are ""unknown"" or ""untrusted"" or ""unregistered"" from running (including homemade drivers)VRChat devs, I know you don't care because you're hiding all the complaint posts on the feedback canny and ignore everyone's requests to just add the QoL mod ideas into the game, but for the love of god don't add EAC and listen to your community's requests. It is not good for the innocent users, the ""wholesome"" modders, and the QoL modders. Don't get me wrong, I love the community and opportunities this game has provided to me, but this is just an awful move from the devs, even with me not caring for client mods. Also maybe consider change whoever is writing the blog posts, they're so super tone deaf."

11,"February 11, 2021",Recommended,390.5 ,"this game has really made me want to get a vr headset to enjoy the game EVEN MORE, this game is an absolute work of art, you can become any avatar you wish just by downloading it but here are some things to know to start off1: if you want to see all of the avatars MAKE SURE your pc can handle it2:clearing the cache DOES NOT remove your avatars and maps, only the other peoples avatars and maps, make sure you do this to increase performance, i do it at least once every 1/2 days3: c to crouch on pc, z to crawl on pc4: to change your avatars facial expression (not all have facial expressions) do shift F1-F85: some avatars may have cool things you may want to try out!, do RIGHT shift and f1-f2 to enable and disable6:to see everybody`s avatar, make sure to press escape after you chose your avatar and go into the safety menu and press none, this will let you see every character7: to block a user (you wont see their avatar or hear them) you press escape, look away from your menu, click on the bubble thing sorrounding then and then go into user details and click block, to unblock you will have to go into social in the same game as the person you blocked, click on them and do the same steps except unblock8: to add friends, you press escape, left click on a user and do add friends, this will send them a friend request and you will be able to see when theyre online and what theyre doing depending on if they choose to share this information or not9: if you have mild epilepsy or epilepsy or maybe even seizures, beware, this game is most likely not for you if you have the safety mode on none, there may be some users with flashing rainbows and quick changing colours, there may also be some users which occasionally have a offensive avatar or insignia, so watch out for those and remember how to block themand finally number 10: be polite and respectful to others and dont go name calling and dont be rude, this is not liked in the community, though you can still joke around. make sure its not offensive thoughand what i would consider the most important step and how to stop being the trust level ''visitor'', step11: to stop being a visitor you shouldnt sign in through steam first but if you did so already and have  a few avatars and maps favourited worry not, click on create account once you start the game and make an account on the VRchat website, then go into the settings in game and click on upgrade account and generate a code, then type the code into VRchats website after you made an account and that will merge your accounts, meaning that all stuff from the old profile will now be in the new one! including friends, avatars and maps, but know it may take up to an hour, then enjoy VRchat!those are what i would call the 11 things to know about VRchat before getting it, i will also say one more important detail-----==YOU DO NOT NEED A VR HEADSET TO PLAY VRCHAT==-----yes it is called VRchat but you can also play it on pc simply, just download the game and when starting it lets you choose between pc and steamVR, choose PC and you will play perfectly normal on PC, anyway that was me just telling you what to expect and 11 important tips i believe everybody should know, stay safe and im signing off!-Marcin <3"
12,"July 25, 2022",Not Recommended,"1,575.0 ","horrible devs, entirely disconnected from the community and what they want.edit: they are trying to add features to appeal to the community and replace the mod functions but they are often rushed, buggy, and cause additional bugs.

21,"July 25, 2022",Not Recommended,"4,610.7 ","3,864 hours on record at the time of this review. This game saved my life to be honest. I was at a dark spot in my life alone no friends to actively talk to and antisocial as all hell. There were the good times like meeting my best friend and finally finding my footing on who i am. And there were the bad times like dealing with the crashers and hackers and dealing with manipulators. We built walls in the form of anti-crash mods to defend ourselves from those subhumans we built crutches in the form of mods to assist those who have medical problems or poor preforming computers.300+ friends. All of which varied in many ways. Some were the fearless types ready to take of the pain of life. Some were the gentle type those to ease your burdens and be a shoulder to cry on. Others were the funny type with a joke or a perfectly timed soundboard to make everyone laugh.1 update. One update just shattered all of this. With the anti-cheat the only people being punished are those who use mods to assist in playing the game. No more better frame rates due to a AI upscale system. No more sign language assistance mods. No more anti-crash the only thing keeping the subhumans at bay. All of it. Gone. Yet the subhumans have free reign of this game now as easy anti-cheat is a easy to bypass system. Its the one ply toilet paper of the gaming world.Vrchat was a good game. But what killed it was not the hackers or the rippers or the crashers. No it was greed. If it was not for this game i feel like I would of committed suicide with how alone I was before i found this game. I just hope that we don't have to watch it die."

23,"September 1, 2022",Not Recommended,"1,158.7 ","This probably won't reach many eyes that can change anything, but I feel an urge to vent stuff that has been weighing on my mind.Why are you only just adding the features people have been asking about since 2014 in the past month? It's good that you're adding SOME of them now, but did you not care? Are you taking code from the modding scene you destroyed to make yourself look better?If you can add such systems like a personal portable mirror in a month, why has it taken 8 years to produce when it has been requested over and over? It has to be either you were too lazy to add it previously or, now that the work has been done for you by other people, you're taking other people's work and putting it in your game.Why are you annoying the creators who make the content for your game by updating your TOS to take the things they make? Do you plan on making a market place to sell the stuff you've snatched the rights for?You implemented EAC so that you can try to stop avatar ripping, but you're then updating your TOS so that you can take the avatars instead.How can you take something so good, that I loved so much, and make it bring me so much hate now?Rant over, enjoy your money I guess, I'll be looking for alternatives to produce content for."
